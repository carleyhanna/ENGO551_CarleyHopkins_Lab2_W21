# ENGO551_CarleyHopkins_Lab2_W21
This repository contains the files and information required for the ENGO 551 W21 Lab 2 deliverables. 


This lab displays a map of the city of Calgary, along with the building permits associated with it.
This map should be able to search for building permits by issue dates, or by a range of issue dates.
As well, users can identify building permits through the use of a pop up, which displays information about the building permit in the clicked on area.
The pop up should display the issue date, the work class group, the contractor name, the community name, and the original address.
