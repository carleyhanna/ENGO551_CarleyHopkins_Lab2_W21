# ENGO551_CarleyHopkins_Lab2_Lab3_W21
This repository contains the files and information required for the ENGO 551 W21 Lab 2 deliverables. 


This lab displays a map of the city of Calgary, along with the building permits associated with it.
This map should be able to search for building permits by issue dates, or by a range of issue dates.
As well, users can identify building permits through the use of a pop up, which displays information about the building permit in the clicked on area.
The pop up should display the issue date, the work class group, the contractor name, the community name, and the original address.

LAB 3 CHANGES

**For TA:
Please note that changes were made through Desktop GitHub via a cloned repository.
GitHub Desktop did not allow these changes to be pushed back to the online repository, and due to time this issue was not able to be resolved before the due date.
Below I have included changes made to lab 2 files: mapbase.html and building_permits.js in "ENGO551_Lab3_LocalChanges.pdf". These edited files have been manually added to the online repository, along with the files created for lab 3.  **

INSTRUCTIONS
Open mapbase.html to your preferred browser.
